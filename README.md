# IoT-Connect Yocto Integration
***IoT-Connect connect layer for `dunfell` yocto release***

***Note***: tested only on RPI4B so far.

*The following details yocto layers designed to integrate the [IoT-Connect C SDK](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/iotc-generic-c-sdk). The end result is a compiled version of the `basic-sample` app provided in the C SDK repo that is installed to an image target. Once said image is flashed to a target, the basic-sample app should successfully run & establish comms with an appropriately setup https://avnet.iotconnect.io/*

## Layers
There are 2 layers thus far: `meta-iotconnect` & `meta-myExampleIotconnectLayer`.
### How to include layers
To include the layers within a yocto enviroment:

1. check them out to the `sources` directory in your yocto enviroment.

1. add them to `conf/bblayers` file in your build directory

1. add recipes as a part of your image (for example in `<meta-my-layer>/recipes-core/images/<image-name.bb>` file) or to your local build configuration (in `local.conf` for example) - `IMAGE_INSTALL += " iot-c-sdk"`

1. build with a bitbake call e.g. `./bitbake <image-name>`

***Note***: you might need adding lines below to your image
```
inherit core-image
inherit module
inherit extrausers
```

### Description of layers
#### meta-iotconnect
Contains the git urls for checkouts, recipe definitions & a patch file for temporarily fixing the CMake `find_package` issue. This layer sets the build target to `basic-sample`. This might get further subdivided in the future to only provide IoT-Connect libraries to other layers.
#### meta-myExampleIotconnectLayer
It's expected that developers will have to provide bespoke elements for their application. In the `basic-sample` example you're required to edit `app-config.h`. This layer provides an example of how a user might specify custom requirements of an application within their layer that's then compiled & built for use: in this case the `app-config.h` specifics.
